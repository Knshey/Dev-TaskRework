Now we just need to complete series 4 through 5

[Exercises] 3.1 ~Compute the max value inside a list of numbers

3.2 ~Create an empty list, ask the user to give 5 numbers, and print the max value 

3.3 ~Create an empty list, ask the user to give numbers, stops when the number is 0, and print the max value

Thanks 4 see this.. If you are a more advanced connoisseur of the language... It would be very helpful if you evaluated my code and see how I'm doing~!&
